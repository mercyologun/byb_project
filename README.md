Iteration (while.py, pattern.py)

Iteration in Python is crucial because it allows for the efficient processing and manipulation of data structures like lists, dictionaries, and sets. 
By iterating over these structures, you can perform repeated tasks without manually writing redundant code, making programs more concise and easier to maintain. 
Iteration is also fundamental in tasks such as data processing, algorithm implementation, and automating repetitive operations, enhancing both the functionality and performance of Python applications.

In the while.py task I wrote a program that continually asks the user to enter a number.

in the pattern.py task, I wrote a code to output a pattern, using an if-else statement in combination with a single for loop
